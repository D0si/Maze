# Maze Element System ![Build Maze](https://github.com/d0si/Maze/workflows/Build%20Maze/badge.svg?branch=master)

Maze is C++ library that allows you to use dynamic objects (similarly to something like JavaScript objects) as normal C++ values and construct complex objects without the need for declarations in form of classes or structs (this comes at a cost of more memory and slight performance hit).

It can be used to quickly load and process JSON data or even to be integrated into applications and allow for customizable data input.
